# ThreadTradingApp

Thread Trading Company is a full-stack web application using React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. The project allows users to view and manage trading products through a modern interface. The backend provides a RESTful API, while the frontend uses React components to fetch and display product data.

The project is divided into two main directories: `backend/` (API and server logic) and `frontend/` (React client). 
 
To run the app locally, ensure Node.js and MongoDB are installed. Clone the repository, run `npm install` inside both `backend/` and `frontend/` directories. 
Start the backend server by running `node app.js` from the `backend/` folder (runs on port 5000), and start the React app with `npm start` from the `frontend/` folder (runs on port 3000).
This setup serves as a solid base for building more advanced features such as authentication, product search, or admin management.
